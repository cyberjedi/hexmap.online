This is a React/Node.js web application for tabletop RPG mapping (HexMap.Online).
- Follow the React functional component pattern with hooks
- Use Socket.io for real-time communication
- MySQL database with normalized structure
- Optimize for mobile/tablet support with responsive design
- Firebase authentication
- Ensure compatibility with Discord Activity embedding:
  - Use relative URLs for assets and API endpoints where possible
  - Do not set restrictive X-Frame-Options headers
  - Configure CSP headers to allow Discord embedding
  - Design UI to work well within Discord's iframe constraints

My local environment is MacOS. Use terminal comments to do filesystem work.
